## What is Heap in javascript

## What is call stack in javascript

## What is call back queue in javascript

## What is Event Loop

The event loop monitors the call stack and callback queue. If the stack is empty, it pushes the first callback from the queue into the stack.

**Example:**

```javascript
console.log("Script start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside setTimeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Inside Promise");
});

console.log("Script end");
```

**output:**

```bash
Script start
Script end
Inside Promise
Inside setTimeout
```

**Notes:**
Microtasks `(Promises)` are handled before macrotasks `(setTimeout)`.

## What is lexical scope

Lexical scope means a functionâ€™s scope is defined by where the function is written in the code. It determines what variables are accessible to the function based on its position in the source code.

```javascript
function outer() {
  let outerVar = "I'm from outer";

  function inner() {
    console.log(outerVar); // inner can access outerVar
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

`inner() has lexical access to outerVar because it is defined inside the outer() function.
The scope is based on the nesting structure of functions when the code is written.`
